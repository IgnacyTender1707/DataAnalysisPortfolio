Hi! Welcome to my Ted Talk. But seriously, thanks for stopping by
to check my humble portfolio in Data Analysis. My goal is to showcase
my skills and way of thinking, and I am always open to good advice
and feedback.

Short description of my project:

Excel - Employee Data Dashboards
I wanted to show, what I can do, both in terms of use of data and visually. In this project I used: Power Query (data cleaning, creating new columns),
pivot tables (showcasing data), pivot charts (data visualization) and fragmentators (simplified the use of dashboards).
